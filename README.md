This was an exercise done in the hachathon format. We were given 48 hours to build a website within the context: if you had a time machine what technologie would you bring with you to the past? Within the free REST APIs avaiable we choose the FBI most wanted one (https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/api). Due to their unrelaiability we've refatured it.
We picked the wild wild west as a theme an brought a website to search for wanted criminals!

What we've used:
React
Class Components
Lifting up the state of the application
HTML
CSS
